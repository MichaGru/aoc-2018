== Solution written in Java

To build:

    mvn clean install

To run:

   java -jar target/aoc-2018-day05.jar


== Solution part 1

Model the polymer as a string buffer for easier character manipulation.

Implement a `react` routine which simply loops over the string buffer and removes "adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity"
i.e. adjacent characters which only differ in case. The routine returns `true` iff something was removed.

For full reaction, apply `react` routine as long as something gets removed.

== Solution part 2

Implement a `removeUnitType` routine which removes certain unit type from the polymer. I.e. deletes all characters same as the given character,
no matter the case.

Then the solution can be implemented with stream operation chaining:

* Get characters of the string.
* Convert them all to lowercase.
* Get distinct characters.
* Try removing each character.
* Fully react the resulting polymer.
* Look for the shortest result.
